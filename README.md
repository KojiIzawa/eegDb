### What is it all about?
**`eegDb`** is an egglab plugin that eases up managing preprocessing routines. It allows to create project databases for reproducible eeg preprocessing with eeglab.

:construction: The project is currently under construction, the documentation is upcoming :construction:

### Installation
The easiest way to install is to copy the repository to your local drive either by:
* grabbing a zip file provided on the lower right
* or using `git clone`
* or copy-pasting file by file? (no, that's not a very good idea, the list just did not feel complete without a third option  

Then make sure that the directory you copied the repository into (let's say it's `D:\TOOLS\eegDb\`) is on your matlab path and that `eegDb_setup` runs without errors:
```matlab
addpath('D:\TOOLS\eegDb\');
eegDb_setup();
```
